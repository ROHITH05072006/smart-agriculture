## 🌍 Project Overview

**AgriScan AI** is an intelligent farming assistant that empowers farmers — especially smallholder and rural farmers — to detect crop diseases early, receive actionable treatment plans, and make data-driven farming decisions.

Upload a photo of a plant leaf, and the AI engine will:
- Identify the crop type automatically
- Detect diseases with a confidence score
- Estimate severity and potential yield loss
- Recommend treatments, pesticides, and prevention strategies

Beyond disease detection, the platform provides a full-suite farm management dashboard including weather monitoring, soil analysis, fertilizer guidance, pest alerts, irrigation scheduling, market prices, and more — all in **multiple languages**.

**Flow:**
1. **User uploads** a plant leaf image with optional field parameters
2. **AI engine** auto-detects crop type and analyzes the image
3. **Disease detection** runs with confidence scoring and severity assessment
4. **Treatment plan** is generated with pesticide, organic, and preventive recommendations
5. **Results are stored** in scan history (localStorage or database)
6. **Reports** can be exported to Excel or emailed to the farmer
